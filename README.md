# Simple Python Calculator

This is a basic Python program that performs simple arithmetic operations:  
**Addition**, **Subtraction**, **Multiplication**, and **Division**.

## How It Works
1. The user enters two numbers.
2. The user chooses an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. The program computes and prints the result.
